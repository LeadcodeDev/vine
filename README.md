# 🌿 Vine

**Vine** is a robust, typed validation library for Dart/Flutter, designed to simplify and secure data management in
applications inspired by [Vine.js](https://vinejs.dev/docs/introduction)..

Its main objective is to solve the recurring problem of validating user input, external APIs or internal configurations,
a critical step that is often a source of errors and complexity in development.

Unlike manual methods or ad hoc checks, Vine offers a structured, declarative approach to defining validation schemes,
ensuring that data complies with an expected format before it is used, which reduces bugs and improves reliability.

## 🚀 Usage

Vine is a data structure validation library for Dart. You may use it to validate the HTTP request body or any data in
your
backend applications.

### Built for validating form data and JSON payloads

Serializing an HTML form to FormData or a JSON object comes with its own set of quirks.

For example:

- Numbers and booleans are serialized as strings
- Checkboxes are not booleans
- And empty fields are represented as empty strings

Vine handles all these quirks natively, and you never have to perform manual normalization in your codebase.

### Maintainability and reusability

This library meets the typical need for maintainability and security in dynamic ecosystems such as Flutter, where
uncontrolled data can lead to crashes or vulnerabilities.

It offers an elegant solution via a fluid, chainable API, enabling complex validation rules (text length, numeric
ranges, email formats, UUID, etc.) to be described in just a few lines.

For example, a user form can be validated with precise constraints (e.g. `vine.string().email().minLength(5)`) while
transforming the data (trim, case conversion, normalisation), thus avoiding redundant code and repeated checks.

```dart
import 'package:vine/vine.dart';

void main() {
  final validator = vine.compile(
      vine.object({
        'username': vine.string().minLength(3).maxLength(20),
        'email': vine.string().email(),
        'age': vine.number().min(18).optional(),
        'isAdmin': vine.boolean(),
        'features': vine.array(vine.string()),
      }));

  try {
    final payload = {
      'username': 'john Doe',
      'email': 'john@example.com',
      'age': 25,
      'isAdmin': true,
      'features': ['MANAGE'],
    };

    final data = vine.validate(payload, validator);
    print('Valid data: $data');
  } on ValidationException catch (e) {
    print('Validation error: ${e.message}');
  }
}
```
